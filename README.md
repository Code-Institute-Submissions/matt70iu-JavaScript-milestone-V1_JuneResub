# My To-Do-List

My to do list was set up as a useful tool which can be put to a variety of uses.
Examples of possible uses include: A shopping list, an inventory list, task list etc. The application is also fully repsonsive and works on a variety of devices as illustrated below.

 ### Features Left to Implement

 - Would like to add a number beside each list item which increases according to the number of items on the list, as well as the already included counter at the top of the list.


## Testing

- Main input field and add button kept popping out of the container on smaller screen sizes. Changed CSS property on input field to 100% of container size to rectify issue.
